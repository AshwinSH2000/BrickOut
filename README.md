Hi, 

This is a project that my friend Shamanth and I had made for our class 12 computer science project between 2016-2018. 
We have fondly called it 'BrickOut.'
It is a simple game that resembles the Atari Breakout developed by Atari Inc. in the year 1976. 
We had utilised the graphics library of C++ extensively to implement the game. 
It is a rather primitive implementation of the original Breakout and misses out on a lot of important features. 
All the details, including the algorithm we adopted, can be found in the project report in this repository.
